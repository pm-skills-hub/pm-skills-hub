description: Review a completed file for code quality, completeness, and best practices

Review the file at `$ARGUMENTS` as a code review. **Do not write code changes to the file.** Instead, add inline TODO(review) comments directly in the file at the relevant lines so the developer can work through them. Always use the `(review)` tag to distinguish these from the developer's own TODO comments. Only manage TODO(review) comments — never touch TODO comments written by the developer.

## Comment Syntax by File Type

Use the correct comment syntax based on the file extension:

- **Python** (`.py`): `# TODO(review): message`
- **HTML/Templates** (`.html`): `<!-- TODO(review): message -->`
- **JavaScript** (`.js`): `// TODO(review): message`
- **CSS** (`.css`): `/* TODO(review): message */`

The same rules apply regardless of syntax: only manage TODO(review) comments, never touch the developer's own TODO comments.

## Review Checklist

### 1. Completeness (MVP Scope)
- Does the code satisfy all requirements defined in `your architecture documentation` and `your getting started guide` for this app/model?
- Are all required fields, methods, and relationships present?
- Is anything missing that the MVP scope expects?

### 2. Type Hints
- Do all function parameters have type annotations?
- Do all functions have return type annotations?
- Is `from __future__ import annotations` present at the top of the module?
- Are `typing` imports used where needed (`Optional`, `list`, `dict`, etc.)?

### 3. Python Best Practices
- Follows PEP 8 naming conventions
- Appropriate use of docstrings
- No unnecessary complexity
- Clean imports (grouped: stdlib, third-party, local)

### 4. Framework Best Practices
- For web frameworks (Django, Rails, etc.): Models/ORMs use appropriate field types and constraints; Views follow framework conventions; URLs/routes are well-structured
- For other frameworks: Follow established patterns and idioms for your stack
- Configuration: No hardcoded values that should be environment-specific

### 5. Security
- No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- Proper use of Django's built-in protections
- Input validation where needed

## Output Format

- Read the file provided in the argument
- Determine which app and feature the file belongs to
- **Check for a featuredoc first:** Look in `your feature documentation directory` for a file matching this feature. If one exists, use it as the completeness reference for the Completeness checklist item. If not, use the relevant `your application documentation`.
- Read `your architecture documentation` and `your getting started guide` to understand context
- **Remove resolved TODO(review)s**: If the file has existing TODO(review) comments from a previous review and the code now satisfies them, delete those TODO comments
- **Add new TODO(review)s**: Add TODO(review) comments inline at specific lines that still need attention, using the correct comment syntax for the file type (see Comment Syntax section above)
- **Clean up TODO(stub)s**: If the file has TODO(stub) comments from a previous stub-backend or stub-ui run, remove them for any section that has been implemented. Leave stub TODOs in place where the section is still empty or incomplete — do not remove a stub just because surrounding code exists
- **Leave developer TODOs alone**: Never modify or remove plain `TODO` comments (without any tag) — those belong to the developer
- After updating TODOs, provide a brief summary of findings grouped by category
- If the file looks good and all TODOs are resolved, say so — don't invent issues that aren't there
