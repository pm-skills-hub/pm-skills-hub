description: Stub out a backend Python file with TODO comments guiding the developer on what to build
disable-model-invocation: true

---

Stub out the backend file at `$ARGUMENTS` with detailed TODO comments that guide the developer through implementing it. **Do not write the actual implementation code.** Instead, add `# TODO(stub): ...` comments that describe what needs to be built at each point in the file.

## Before Stubbing

1. Read the file provided in the argument
2. Identify the file type from its name and your framework's conventions (e.g., signals, middleware, views, forms, configuration, mixins)
3. Identify which module or component it belongs to from its path
4. Read relevant docs:
   - Your architecture documentation — overall patterns and system design approach
   - Your app-specific documentation — the checklist or requirements for this component
   - Your data model definitions — understand the data structures the file will work with
   - For views: also read your routing configuration to understand what routes exist

## Stubbing Rules

- **Do not write Python implementation code** — only TODO comments and the minimal skeleton (see File Type Skeletons below)
- Use `# TODO(stub): ...` for all guidance comments
- Each TODO should describe **what** to build and **why**, with enough detail to look up the right approach
- Reference specific framework patterns, signals, mixins, or decorators by name (e.g., Django patterns, Rails callbacks, FastAPI dependencies) — but don't implement them
- Always include `from __future__ import annotations` at the top — this is a project requirement
- Always note where type hints are needed on functions and what the expected types are
- Order TODOs top-to-bottom matching the logical execution flow of the file

## File Type Skeletons

Each file type has a standard skeleton based on your framework's conventions. Write only the skeleton structure plus TODO comments — no logic. The examples below use Django patterns, but adapt to your framework (Rails, FastAPI, Express, etc.).

### signals.py

Skeleton: `from __future__ import annotations` header, import placeholders, one handler function stub per signal needed.

Key TODOs to include:
- What signal to connect to (`post_save`, etc.) and on which sender model
- The required function signature (`sender`, `instance`, `created`, `**kwargs`) and type hints
- What objects to create inside the handler and in what order (e.g., create Account before AccountMembership)
- That `created` must be checked before doing anything — explain why (signal fires on updates too)
- The `@receiver` decorator and where to import it from

### middleware.py

Skeleton: `from __future__ import annotations` header, import placeholders, one class with `__init__` and `__call__` stubs.

Key TODOs to include:
- The `__init__(self, get_response: Callable) -> None` signature and what `get_response` is
- The `__call__(self, request: HttpRequest) -> HttpResponse` signature
- Where in `__call__` to do pre-processing vs post-processing (before and after `get_response(request)`)
- How to check if the user is authenticated before querying
- What to attach to `request` and what to set when unauthenticated
- That it must be registered in your middleware configuration after authentication middleware

### views.py

Skeleton: `from __future__ import annotations` header, import placeholders, one class or function stub per view.

Key TODOs to include:
- Whether to use a class-based view or function-based view and why
- Which mixins apply (e.g., `LoginRequiredMixin`) and their import source
- What context variables to pass to the template and where they come from
- Which template to render (using your project's template organization convention)
- For form views: where form validation logic goes, what happens on success vs failure
- Type hints for all parameters and return types

### forms.py

Skeleton: `from __future__ import annotations` header, import placeholders, one form class stub per form.

Key TODOs to include:
- Whether it's a `Form` or `ModelForm` and which model it binds to
- Which fields to include/exclude in the `Meta` class
- Any custom `clean_<field>` or `clean` methods needed and what they validate
- Widget overrides if the default rendering is wrong for the field type
- Type hints on any custom methods

### apps.py

Skeleton: `from __future__ import annotations` header, existing `AppConfig` class with a `ready()` method stub added.

Key TODOs to include:
- That `ready()` is the correct place to import signals — explain why (avoids circular imports at module load time)
- The exact import pattern to use inside `ready()` (import the signals module, not individual functions)
- A note that `ready()` should only contain signal wiring, not business logic

### mixins.py

Skeleton: `from __future__ import annotations` header, import placeholders, one mixin class stub per mixin needed.

Key TODOs to include:
- That a mixin is a plain Python class (no `models.Model`, no `View` base) — it relies on MRO to pick up `get_queryset` from the view it's mixed into
- The method to override is `get_queryset(self) -> QuerySet` — import `QuerySet` from `django.db.models`
- That `self.request.account` is available because your tenant middleware attaches it — check for `None` and raise `PermissionDenied` (import from `django.core.exceptions`) if so
- To call `super().get_queryset()` first to get the base queryset, then filter it — explain why calling super() is important (respects any queryset narrowing already done by the view)
- The filter to apply: `.filter(account=self.request.account)`
- That this mixin should always be used alongside `LoginRequiredMixin` (which should come first in the MRO) to ensure unauthenticated users are redirected before `get_queryset` is ever called

## After Stubbing

- Provide a brief summary in the chat listing what was stubbed and any open decisions the developer should think about
- Call out any dependencies between files (e.g., "apps.py `ready()` must import signals.py, write signals.py first")
- Reference relevant Django docs sections by name (e.g., "Django signals docs", "Writing middleware")
- Use pseudocode or generic examples in the chat to explain concepts — do not give the exact answer

## Managing Stubs

- Only manage `# TODO(stub): ...` comments — never touch `# TODO: ...` or `# TODO(review): ...` comments
- On subsequent runs, remove TODO(stub) comments for sections the developer has implemented
- Add new TODO(stub) comments if requirements have changed or new context is available
